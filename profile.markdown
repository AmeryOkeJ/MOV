\##Furniture Services
Move-in saves time and money. We even make your bed and program your television. It’s a complete furniture service.

Move-in custom designs furniture to suit specific needs and can produce prototype ranges for multi-room clients. We also oversee the manufacture of all products, ensuring the highest level of design and quality in every room.

Our team of visual designers and stylists supervise the delivery and coordinate the installation – we even remove the boxes, prepare fresh flowers and style the interiors for a showroom quality finish.

Move-in provides full customer service and project management. Every installation is thoroughly controlled and approved by a Move-in representative with a warranty booklet and hand-over manual provided at the completion of every furniture package installation.
